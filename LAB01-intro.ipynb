    "# Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the steps in this exercise, you will practice making some plots of near-real time ocean data from a Seaglider and share a little about your interests with your lab group and instructors.  The reasons this activity is relevant to EOS1505 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The types of plots made here are similar to the reading for next week.  This data is real-world context!\n",
    "2. You will be able to use this notebook to check on the Seaglider occasionally, which will culminate in a project.  The code here can be reused as starter code for your project. (Don't forget to reference it if you use it!)\n",
    "3. You have the chance to practice using the `Blackboard link ->  GitHub Classroom -> HPC Grid -> PDF to Blackboard` workflow used for **some** (but not all) of the assignments in this class.  By completing this assignment, you can verify you have access to all the necessary resources and you can see exactly the same process for submitting other assingments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept this assignment in GitHub Classroom.\n",
    "2. Download this file to the Bowdoin HPC grid by typing the following into the terminal where `<your_username>` (including the angle braces) is replaced by your github username:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/Bowdoin-EOS1505-S21/HW01-intro-<your_username>.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Open the notebook via the JupyterHub interface.\n",
    "4. Answer the questions at the beginning of this assignment by typing into the cells as indicated.  If you are comfortable sharing your answers with your lab group, these questions will be a good way to get to know your peers.\n",
    "5. Run the code cells at the end of the notebook to make plots.\n",
    "6. Save your answers by clicking on the floppy disk image in the upper left corner.\n",
    "7. Save the assignment as a `.pdf` by clicking on the menu items: `File`->`Download as`->`PDF via Latex (.pdf)`.  If that doesn't work, use your web browser's print to `.pdf` functionality to create a `.pdf` of your notebook.\n",
    "8. Upload the `.pdf` to Blackboard.\n",
    "9. ***(Optional)*** Upload your assignment back to GitHub for potential sharing with peers with the following terminal commands (\\#-prefixed text are comments describing each line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd HW01-intro-<your_username>.git   # Change into the repository directory\n",
    "git add .                           # Stage the changes you've made -> take a snapshot\n",
    "git commit -m \"Short message here\"  # Commit your changes, including a short description in quotes\n",
    "git push origin                     # Push changes back up to GitHub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some details when using `git commit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip this section if you don't plan on pushing commits back to GitHub.  You can always change your mind later.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use `git commit` you'll need to first tell git who you are.\n",
    "It needs to know your name and email.  In this repository, the `git_setup.sh`\n",
    "will prompt you for this information and you'll be all set up.  To run the\n",
    "script, at the terminal prompt, enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./git_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to provide your actual e-mail, it will still work if you\n",
    "enter any text at all (just no spaces or non-alphabetical characters). \n",
    "For example, `aaa` works too!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use `git commit` without the `-m` option, you will \n",
    "need to enter text to describe the changes you made using the vi text \n",
    "editor.  To do this,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. press `a` to enter edit mode and add text,\n",
    "2. type a short description of your changes,\n",
    "3. press `Esc` to get out of edit mode,\n",
    "4. type `:w` to save your changes to the commit file, and\n",
    "5. type `:q` to quit vi.\n",
    "\n",
    "While vi feels clunky, this basic skill is helpful as vi is present on lots of computer systems, especially the ones used to interact with autonomous underwater vehicles.  The files that control the behavior of these underwater robots are often modified with vi.  Frankly, steps 1-5 above are the only vi commands I know, but [they are enough to pilot a Seaglider 3,400 km](https://phys.org/news/2015-07-robotic-gliders-herald-sea-ocean.html).\n",
