    "# Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the steps in this exercise, you will practice making some plots of [near-real time ocean data from a Seaglider](http://vocal.sams.ac.uk/glider.php?missionid=40&device=sg605) and share a little about your interests with your lab group and instructors.  The reasons this activity is relevant to EOS1505 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The types of plots made here are similar to the reading for next week.  This data is real-world context!\n",
    "2. You will be able to use this notebook to check on the Seaglider occasionally, which will culminate in a project.  The code here can be reused as starter code for your project. (Don't forget to reference it if you use it!)\n",
    "3. You have the chance to practice using the `Blackboard link ->  GitHub Classroom -> HPC Grid -> PDF to Blackboard` workflow used for **some** (but not all) of the assignments in this class.  By completing this assignment, you can verify you have access to all the necessary resources and you can see exactly the same process for submitting other assingments.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. After accepting this assignment via the link on Blackboard and cloning your repository to the Bowdoin HPC grid, answer the questions at the beginning of this assignment by typing into the cells as indicated.  If you are comfortable sharing your answers with your lab group, these questions will be a good way to get to know your peers.  \n",
    "2. Save your answers by clicking on the floppy disk image in the upper left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab:\n",
    "3. Run the code cells at the end of the notebook to make plots.\n",
    "4. Answer the two discussion questions at the very end of the notebook.\n",
    "5. Save the notebook. \n",
    "6. Save the assignment as a `.pdf` by clicking on the menu items: `File`->`Download as`->`PDF via Latex (.pdf)`.  If that doesn't work, use your web browser's print to `.pdf` functionality to create a `.pdf` of your notebook.\n",
    "7. Upload the `.pdf` to Blackboard.\n",
    "8. ***(Optional)*** Upload your assignment back to GitHub for potential sharing with peers following the separate instructions at the very end of this notebook.\n",
